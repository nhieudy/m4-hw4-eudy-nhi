          <h2>About Clairo</h2>
          <p>
            From Rolling Stone: Claire Cottrill was just 19 when she uploaded
            “Pretty Girl” under Clairo on YouTube, a song she wrote in a single
            day. With straightforward, relatable lyrics (“And I could be a
            pretty girl/I'll wear a skirt for you”) and delicate bedroom pop
            melodies, the track unexpectedly went viral. “It was just a little
            thing,” she told us, reflecting on the career-making moment in 2021.
            “It was not supposed to be anything.”<br />

          <h3>Clairo's Third Album: Charm</h3>
          <p>
            From Staged Haze:As she progresses as a woman and an artist, the
            25-year-old is documenting her experiences in a sincere way, and
            delivering with the tone of someone that knows that this is just how
            it goes for everybody else, too. She has found her voice and her
            space in the music sphere and is just using both to share her story
            in the realest and prettiest way. Third time is a charm.
          </p>
          <h3>No Need for Labels</h3>
          <p>
            From Billboard: In a new cover story for Seventeen, the “Sexy to
            Someone” singer explained why she prefers not to put a label on her
            sexuality. “I do not care for labels at all. I believe people should
            like who they want and no one should have a problem with it,” she
            said. “I have had a better experience with my queerness once I just
            shut the ... up and let it happen to me. If I date a girl, I date a
            girl. If I date a guy, I date a guy.”
          </p>
          <h3>Why I Love Her Music</h3>
          <p>
            Clairo's music is emotional and raw. Her voice is soft and dreamy.
            It's the perfect music to put on to relax to, and I love working and
            reading to it as well. I hope to see her live someday!
